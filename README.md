# Themis Chimney

Themis Chimney began as a project just for a landing page so people can view their product and services.  Themis wanted a online presence that contained their contact information for communication.  As time went on, they played with an idea of having their own application.  They would like to manage their projects, contractors, employees and employee time.  This is not the actual application that will be used in production.  I created this to show them how an application can organized their working environment.
